# Detection Server

The detection server of the demo

## Install

The node requires ROS2 environment and `requests` library. Make sure not to run the node in the same environment with the server. You should run this in the global ROS environment.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

You can run the node with the following command (assuming the package name is `ros_node`):

```bash
rosrun ros_node main.py
```
